              I attended high school in Å½eleznik &#40;Belgrade&#41;, computer
              electrician course, and graduated with excellent grades
              &#40;average &#62; 4,5&#41;.
            </p>
            <p>
              Relevant technologies I learned are C and C# PLs, and Assembly
              basics.

              I then earned my Bachelor's in Computer Science from VISER, new
              computer technologies course. My studies covered many different
              courses and interesting topics.

            <p>
              I've learned about many different PLs, RDMBS, DSA, Software
              testing, Wordpress, Art and Animation, Networking and Security,
              Linux architecture, and even developed my own game in Unity Game
              Engine.

              For the past three years, I was studying web technologies on free
              resources such as W3Schools, FreeCodeCamp, Youtube, and other paid
              sources such as Udemy and Zero To Mastery Academy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both personal and course projects helped me grow a lot. By reading
              documentation and experimenting with different technologies, I've
              developed a strong foundation in programming.

              I am currently looking for my first job in IT at a company where I
              can begin my journey, learn, and contribute. While I have prior
              work experience, this will be my first role in IT programming.
